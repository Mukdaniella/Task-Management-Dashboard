# Task Management Dashboard

## Description
The **Task Management Dashboard** is a simple web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, set due dates, mark tasks as completed, edit or delete tasks, filter tasks based on their status, and sort tasks by due date. All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions.  

This project is ideal for beginners to learn HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript by building a functional, interactive dashboard.
